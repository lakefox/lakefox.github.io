                    Hi there, I'm Mason Wright, a web developer and blogger based in the United States. I discovered my
                    passion for
                    programming back in 2015 and have been building web applications ever since, mainly using JavaScript
                    and Node.js.
                    Recently, I've been exploring Svelte and loving its simplicity and performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before pursuing a career in tech, I served in the military after graduating from high school. This
                    experience taught me
                    valuable skills such as discipline, teamwork, and problem-solving, which I apply in my work today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm passionate about web technologies because I believe they offer the best way to share information
                    and software with
                    the world. That's why I'm currently working on my tech blog called DECODE, where I share my thoughts
                    on the latest web
                    development trends and tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to my tech blog, I also run a food blog called TASTE and a general repair blog called
                    HANDY. Blogging allows
                    me to combine my interests in writing and technology, and I'm always looking for new ways to improve
                    my skills and
                    expand my knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not coding or blogging, you can find me working out, reading, or trying out new recipes in
                    the kitchen. I'm excited
                    about the future of web development and can't wait to see where this ever-evolving field takes me
                    next.
                </p>

                    LOW (<a href="https://low.sh">low.sh</a>) is a suite of tutorial websites, characterized by a
                    consistent look and feel. The websites are powered by a
                    bespoke blogging engine, endowed with a plethora of functionalities such as a post editor, a comment
                    section, a
                    newsletter and an ecommerce store. The platform follows a minimalist design philosophy, requiring
                    only the posting of
                    content by site administrators, with all other aspects automatically generated by the engine. Even
                    the meta descriptions
                    are created by a sophisticated text summarization algorithm, which handpicks the most captivating
                    sentences for
                    inclusion in the description. This singular feature has been observed to boost the click-through
                    rate by an average of
                    1.3%.

                    Chit Chat is a free messaging platform hosted on Vercel. The goal of creating this was to make a
                    censorship-free platform that is end-to-end encrypted and uses Web-RTC for all communications. Chit
                    Chat is secured using a custom encryption algorithm that I will go further into detail about later.
                    The messages are encrypted on every channel and there are options to encrypt the messages so only
                    people in the room you are in with the password can view them. The Web-RTC connections are not done
                    using the Chit Chat server but instead are routed through the web-torrent network that also uses the
                    Web-RTC protocol.

                    KOD.JS generates images of code like the one above (the code above was used to generate itself). The
                    reason I created this instead of using the wonderful <a
                        href="https://carbon.now.sh">carbon.now.sh</a> is carbon is only
                    good for manually generating
                    code snippets. I needed something that was able to make the screenshots on the server and in the
                    browser. KOD.JS is kept lightweight by only loading the language and CSS file after the init
                    functional is called, so you aren't shipping not used code to the client side.

                    cipherHash is an encryption algorithm developed as a fun project for unsecured projects. It uses a
                    system that breaks
                    the message into character codes, numbers representing every possible character. Then it takes the
                    character code and
                    turns it into a hex string which is why the messages are always longer than the original. Once it's
                    a hex string the
                    password is hashed, then if the hash of the password is shorter than the message the hash gets
                    hashed again and appended
                    to the original hash. This continues until the password is the length of the message, then each
                    character is ciphered
                    with the corresponding character in the hash string. This ensures the encryption is 99% secure as
                    long as the SHA256
                    hashing function can not be reversed. This was made as a challenge for myself doesn't use this, as I
                    cannot guarantee
                    that no one can break it is, but this is a pretty good encryption tool.

                    I have many more projects, too many to be added here, that are in multiple stages of developement.
                    Some I've stopped working on and some are not meant to be a product of any kind. If you want to see
                    what I am currently working on, the best place to go is to my GitHub below. Thank you for checking
                    this site out, if you have and questions feel free to email me!
